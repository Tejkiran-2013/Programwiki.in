<h1><u>1.Operating system (OS).</u></h1>
<p>An operating system (OS) is the fundamental software that acts as an intermediary between a computer's hardware and the user. Its core purpose is to manage hardware and software resources, providing a stable and efficient environment for applications to run. By handling critical tasks such as process scheduling, memory allocation, file management, and controlling input/output (I/O) devices, the OS abstracts the complexities of the hardware away from the user. Without an OS, a user would need a deep understanding of computer architecture to perform basic tasks like saving a file, playing a video, or printing a document. Common examples include Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux for personal computers, and Android and iOS for mobile devices. </p>

<h1><u>4.Microsoft's windows operating system.</u></h1>
<p>Microsoft Windows is a series of proprietary operating systems developed by Microsoft for personal computers and other devices. Since its 1985 debut, Windows has become the most popular operating system by providing a graphical user interface (GUI) and features like file and task management, multitasking, internet connectivity, and support for a wide range of hardware. Its popularity stems from its user-friendly design, though Microsoft continues to update and release new versions to maintain its market position and add new features.</p>

<h1><u>5.Linux</u></h1>
<p>Linux is a free, open-source operating system known for its security, stability, and flexibility, initially created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It functions as the bridge between hardware and software, managing system resources like the CPU and memory, and powers a vast range of devices from servers and supercomputers to smartphones and smart TVs. Available in hundreds of different versions called distributions, it is a popular choice for developers and organizations due to its customizability and the collaborative, community-driven nature of its development.</p>
